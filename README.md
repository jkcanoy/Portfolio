# Jefferson Kyle Canoy Portfolio

## Description

A simple portfolio of my work 

What Should I Eat?
* A simple random recipe generator. Users select one of four ingredient buttons and a random recipe containing the chosen main ingredient will be generated onto the page.

Password Generator
* A random password generator. Users click the generate password button and will be prompted to choose multiple parameters they would like their password to contain. A random password will be generated based on the parameters chosen.

Coding Quiz
* A timed multiple choice coding quiz. Users will be given 75 seconds to answer several questions related to coding. Correct answers add 1 point to their score, and incorrect answers will dock 10 seconds from the timer. When all questions have been answered or time has run out users will be able to save their initials and high score. A high score page stores all saved initials and scores.
