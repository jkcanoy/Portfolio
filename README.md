## Description

A simple portfolio of my work

Happy Little Art Gallery

- Happy Little Art Gallery is a place where users can post their own art, view comments on their art, and view other artistâ€™s work to either purchase or comment on.

What Should I Eat?

- A simple random recipe generator. Users select one of four ingredient buttons and a random recipe containing the chosen main ingredient will be generated onto the page.

Password Generator

- A random password generator. Users click the generate password button and will be prompted to choose multiple parameters they would like their password to contain. A random password will be generated based on the parameters chosen.

Coding Quiz

- A timed multiple choice coding quiz. Users will be given 75 seconds to answer several questions related to coding. Correct answers add 1 point to their score, and incorrect answers will dock 10 seconds from the timer. When all questions have been answered or time has run out users will be able to save their initials and high score. A high score page stores all saved initials and scores.

Weather Dashboard

- A weather dashboard where users can search for a city, and the current weather - temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index - of the searched city is presented on the screen. The weather for the next five days will be presented on smaller cards below the current weather. A history of searched cities will appear underneath the city search.
